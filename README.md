# Traffic-Control

Implement a simple traffic capturing application using HTML webpage. The application is a web-based system that consists of two parts. The web server written in python and a browser-based client that presents the user interface. To run the code, it is required to run the server by executing python server.py port from the command prompt while in the directory containing the support files with an appropriate port number, e.g. 8081. Thus, you can start a web browser and access http://127.0.0.1:8081/ using the browser. This will access the locally running server and display the index.html page that allows a user to login.
